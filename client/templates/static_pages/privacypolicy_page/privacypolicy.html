        <p>{{appName}} encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from {{appName}} so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. {{appName}} is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the {{appName}} website.</p>

        <h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>{{appName}} collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.</p>

        <p>{{appName}} does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>

        <p>{{appName}} may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. {{appName}} may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries.

        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

        <p>The {{appName}} website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize {{appName}} pages, or register with {{appName}} site or services, a cookie helps {{appName}} to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same {{appName}} website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the {{appName}} features that you customized.</p>

        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the {{appName}} services or websites you visit.</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, {{appName}} uses the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Comodo Positive SSL</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
